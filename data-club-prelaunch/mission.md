# Mission

The mission of Data Club is to offer a series of strategic lessons and a
supportive meeting space for members of the Columbia community of all levels
to learn, share, and implement the philosophies, tools, and methodologies for
a data-driven project of their choosing. In eight weekly meetings, the Data
Club offers a short instructive session, free-work time, and a collaborative
and exploratory environment for researchers to pursue a personal project with
the assistance of Columbia University librarians and their data-minded peers.
