# Mission
  
The mission of Data Club is to offer a series of strategic lessons and a supportive meeting space for students to learn, share, and implement the philosophies, tools, and methodologies for a data science project of their choosing. In each of 8 weekly convenings, The Data Club will offer a short instructive session, free-work time, and a collaborative and exploratory environment for students to pursue a personal project with the assistance of Columbia University librarians and their fellow data-minded students.
