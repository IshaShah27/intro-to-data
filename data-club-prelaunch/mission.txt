The mission of Data Club is to offer a strategic, 8-week series of lessons and meeting space for students to learn, share, and implement the philosophies, tools, and methodologies for a data science project of their choosing. The Data Club offers a collaborative and exploratory environment, short instructive sessions, and free-working and accountability time for students to pursue a personal project with the assistance of Columbia University librarians and their fellow data-minded students.
