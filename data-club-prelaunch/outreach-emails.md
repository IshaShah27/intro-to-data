## Email to department/program coordinators:

Do you know of any students looking to engage in exploratory data projects in a supportive, collaborative environment?  
  
Columbia University Libraries is hosting eight weekly Data Club meetings this semester. Each meeting offers introductory instruction on a data analytics and data science topic, in a collaborative space for knowledge exchange, with the support and guidance of Columbia University librarians. 

Data Club meetings are open to anyone in the Columbia community who wants to learn more about how to creatively and rigorously answer questions using data, regardless of background or experience. 

We believe that the instruction, camaraderie, and accountability that Data Club provides is especially ideal for those working on a personal data project they aim to complete by the end of the 8–week period, including:  

* students and researchers eager to learn about specific tools and methods in Python for exploratory analysis
* students and researchers curious about incorporating data into their research
* students and researchers looking to make progress on their theses
* students and researchers seeking to add a data-driven project to their portfolio

Data Club meets weekly on each Monday from February 17 to April 20, from 5:30 to 7 pm in 215 Lehman. The topics covered over these 8 weeks will include:

The last session of Data Club will feature peer presentations, where members can practice communicating their data work. If you know any students or researchers who would find this directed session and space helpful, please direct them to our first meeting on February 17 from 5:30 to 7pm and to sign up for our Data Club mailing list [here].  
  
  
Sincerely,

### Email to students (blast):
  
Do you have a question you want to answer using data, but you're not sure where to start?

Do you have a data project you've started, but you could use some advice on getting to the finish line? 

Or, do you just need a collaborative environment with some accountability partners to complete a data project for your thesis/personal curiosity/portfolio?
