## Email to department/program coordinators:

Do you know of any students looking to engage in exploratory data projects in a supportive, collaborative environment?  
  
For 8 weeks this semester, Columbia University Libraries will be hosting weekly convenings of Data Club. Each of these 8 Data Club meetings will offer introductory instruction on a data analytics and data science topic, a collaborative space for knowledge exchange, and the support and guidance of Columbia University librarians. Data Club meetings are open to all who want to learn more about how to creatively and rigorously answer questions using data, regardless of background. We believe that the instruction, camaraderie, and accountability that Data Club provides will be especially ideal for students working a personal data project they aim to complete by the end of the 8-week period, including undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students looking to make progress on sub-parts of their theses or students seeking to finish a project to add to their portfolio.  
  
Data Club will meet weekly on each Monday from February 17 to April 20, from 5:30 to 7 pm in 215 Lehman. The topics covered over these 8 weeks will include:  
  
[syllabus here once finalized]  
  
The last session of Data Club will be devoted to peer presentations, where students are given the opportunity to practice communicating their data work. If you know any students who would find this directed session and space helpful, please direct them to our first meeting on February 17 from 5:30-7pm and to sign up for our Data Club mailing list [here].  
  
  
Sincerely,  

Columbia University Libraries
